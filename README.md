# LRU Cache

A caching mechanism through which least recently used items are discarded first.
Following code implements a prototype of LRU cache in c++ using unordered map and list STL.

It takes in input as a key and a value pair.

## lru.cpp
A basic implementation with key and value pair hard-coded as int and int identifier respectively.

## lru_generic.cpp
A more generic implementation using templates. Key and value pair can be user defined.
The driver main function has taken int and string identifier as an example.
